# product-review-analysis
The project "Product review analysis" is based on a Data Mining project which is developed using Java programming language. This is a microproject that is developed for college. The product review analysis works like this: The user will use the application of a Bakery and when he/she buys a cake they have to fill up the feedback form for that type of cake. The feedback is stored in an oracle database using Java Database connectivity. The front end of the application is developed in Java programming language which includes features like forms development in swings. Once the reviews are collected at the backend, the reviews are distributed into 3 clusters, the cluster centroids are 1,3,5 feedback. The reviews are distributed by calculating the euclidean distance from the feedback to the centroid using the K-means clustering algorithm. the feedback is then stored in a cluster whose euclidean distance is less than the others. The clustering is done for each type of cake. If most of the reviews of XYZ cake lie in cluster 1 so it depicts that the reviews on that type of cake are bad, which helps understand the owner that she has to improve the quality of that cake. The backend is a command line based.
